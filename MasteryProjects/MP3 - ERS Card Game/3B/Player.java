/* The Assignment
// Now that you've built an awesome OO framework for playing cards, let's use what you've done to
// program an actual card game: ERS!
You will not be getting user input to play the game, but instead simulating the gameplay using
probability and printing out a record of the gameplay along with the winner of the game.

// m_playerNum - an integer to identify which player it is
// LinkedList<Card> m_hand - a list of cards that the player has in their hand, the first element in the list is considered to be on "top" and new cards should be added to the "bottom" (end of the list)
// a String representing the type of pattern this player watches for, chosen at random from the Game class's patterns array
